release waiver upon arrival as well as a registration form for anyone with

<p>We strive to make Coracle a safe and beautiful experience for every
participant. It is your responsibility to make sure you are not on any other
regional’s ban list. If you are on any regional burn banned list you will be
denied entry and you will not get a refund.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">General Survival</h2>

<p>You must bring enough food, water, shelter, prescriptions, etc. to survive in
the environment while attending Coracle. Bring a cup, fork, spoon, and
knife.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">At your Own Risk</h2>

<p>Coracle is an "At Your Own Risk" event. You will be required to sign a
release waiver before entering Coracle.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Wrist Bands</h2>

<p>This is a private event on private property. If you have lost your wristband,
you should go to the Front Gate immediately to get a new one. You will
need your ID to verify your original ticket purchase. Anyone seen without a
wristband will be escorted to the gate. If you do not comply with wristband
protocol you are trespassing on private property, and we will involve law
enforcement.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Medical Concerns and Security</h2>

<p>In the case of a medical emergency there will be a medical station operated
by Arise Event Services, LLC (AES) located near the permanent bathrooms
centrally located. Please send someone to the medical station in the case of
an emergency. AES provides medical and security services with
personalized quality care from licensed and experienced staff. There will
be Medical Staff at a medical booth, and/or roaming, and on the radio for
the entirety of the contracted Event. For any and all situations that require
more than basic First Aid care, AES will serve as liaisons with local EMS, as
necessary.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Rangers</h2>

<p>Coracle has contracted the services of Arise Event Services, LLC. Safety
Staff will be on shift and roaming during all hours of Coracle and they are
trained to handle any and all situations.</p>

<p>Arise will also have Medical Staff at a medical booth and/or roaming and
on radio for the entirety of Coracle.</p>

<p>Coracle does not have a volunteer role for Rangers. We are trusting our
intimate and local community to self-ranger and otherwise get help from
the trained staff of Arise.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Covid</h2>

<p>Do whatever you can to engage safely with the Coracle community! We
recommend getting a COVID-19 vaccine before Coracle and testing before
you arrive. While at Coracle if you feel sick or think you’ve been exposed,
please test and quarantine yourself if you test positive. We strongly
recommend wearing a mask and/or social distancing.</p>

<p>All persons diagnosed with COVID-19 should isolate until their symptoms
are getting better and they have not had a fever for at least 24 hours. Wear
a well-fitting mask when around others for 5 days. If you develop a fever or
you start to feel worse after you have gone back to normal activities, stay
home and away from others again until, for at least 24 hours, both are true:
your symptoms are improving overall, and you have not had a fever (and
are not using fever-reducing medication). Then take added precaution for
the next 5 days, according to the CDC. More specific details can be found
on their website here.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Wash your hands!</h2>

<p>There are real sinks with warm water and hand soap in the bathrooms
on-site centrally located at Shakori Hills Community Arts Center. Carrying
(and using) hand sanitizer is a good start, but there’s no substitute for
washing with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds as the most
effective way to reduce coronavirus and other contamination on the hands.
Please wash your hands!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Water and Sanitation</h2>

<p>We are lucky to have drinking water stations that provide cold well water.
Please bring a refillable container. There are warm showers and running
water bathrooms on site. Portos are also provided for your convenience;
don’t put items in a porto that you wouldn’t flush at home. Only toilet
paper down the toilets and portos (NO WIPES).</p>

<p>Please bring a bucket/camping potty/pee jug if you or your family are not
comfortable taking a walk to the bathrooms located onsite. Please bring a
roll of extra toilet paper. Please be cautious with water waste at your
campsite.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Food</h2>

<p>You should plan to bring whatever delicious delights you would like to
enjoy at Coracle.</p>

<p>If you are sharing food, disclose the ingredients, as one person’s innocuous
ingredient can be someone else’s allergy.</p>

<p>You can also bring grills and camping stoves. There is no refrigeration
available, but a simple cooler should do given the fall chill. All food waste
needs to be carried out or placed in the compost bins on site.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Ice</h2>

<p>The Off-Center Camp leads have offered to do Ice runs to a store everyday.
If you or your camp needs ice, please stop by at the Off-Center camp before
11am. There will be an envelope to leave cash in. The change can be
collected while picking up the ice. Cash ONLY.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs)</h2>

<p>Visits by local law enforcement are a common occurrence at Shakori Hills
Community Arts Center. They are required to have access when we apply
for a sound permit. The neighbors will most likely call them. Arise Staff
shall liaison and fully cooperate with local Law Enforcement Officers and
Officials. Coracle is conducted in accordance with local, state and federal
laws.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Buddy System</h2>

<p>Find a buddy and do not wander off by yourself. Shakori Hills Community
Arts Center is a very large property and we are an intimate group. There
are no fences inside. Make sure that you are staying in visible areas and
have a buddy. Make sure your children are in your sight at all times.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Children</h2>

<p>Coracle enthusiastically welcomes children of all ages. Children are an
integral part of our community and have been present at every Coracle.
Coracle supports, and even encourages the presence of families. Children
of all ages are welcome, however anyone under 18 years of age must be
accompanied by a ticketed parent or legal guardian. Children 12 and under
are admitted for free but must be registered either online or at the gate
when you check-in. You are responsible for the safety and well-being of
any minor under the age of 18 that you bring to Coracle. Don’t assume your
kids will be safe in someone else’s camp. It’s up to you to be aware of what
is happening and determine what is safe. Children need supervision and
protection at all times. Don’t ever turn your children loose without
supervision.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Lost Child</h2>

<p>Guardians, please keep your children within sight at all times. In the case
of a lost child, go to the ARISE medical booth located near the central
bathrooms for help.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Dogs & Other Animals</h2>

<p>Dogs are not permitted. If you show up with your dog, you will not be
admitted to the event. This restriction is for the well-being and safety of
participants and their four-legged friends.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Physical and Emotional Self-Care</h2>

<p>Make sure you are adequately fed, rested and hydrated. Make sure your
clothes are adequate for the weather (check the weather before the event).
Make sure you are wearing appropriate shoes for the environment. Remove
yourself from a situation if you are feeling emotionally triggered. If you are
experiencing a mental or emotional emergency ask for help at the ARISE
medical booth located near the central bathrooms.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Leave No Trace (LNT)</h2>

<p>Pack it in, pack it out. There is no communal trash or recycling. Please
bring containers and trash bags for both. Shakori Hills Community Arts
center encourages composting. If your camp is serving food to other
participants we encourage that plates, utensils, etc. are compostable or
reusable. Make sure your camp sweeps the area for MOOP (Matter Out Of
Place). We will have LNT volunteers roaming by campsites on Sunday to
help make sure we leave Shakori Hills Community Arts Center in the same
condition or better than we found it.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Alcohol</h2>

<p>Participants 21 and up are invited to bring their own alcohol. You are
responsible for ensuring that alcohol is consumed only by those 21+.
Double check those wrist bands and request identification showing a date
of birth if there is any confusion when sharing among friends. Under 21
wristbands will be bright orange. There is absolutely no serving of alcohol
to minors at Coracle. If such activities occur you will be asked to leave
immediately.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Camping</h2>

<p>There are several open camping areas on site as well as spaces for RV’s.
Please be sure to purchase a Car Pass for each vehicle and an RV pass for
your RV or trailer in advance. There are no RV hookups available onsite.
Upon arrival participants will be able to drive to their campsite to unload,
and then return to the parking area for the duration of the event, unless
you have arrived after dark. In that case, you will need to park in the
parking lot and cart or carry your personal items to your camping area.</p>

<p>Fires aren’t permitted in individual campsites due to tree cover, please
enjoy fires in the designated area or that have been approved by fire safety.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Vehicle Access and Traffic</h2>

<p>A critical component of the Shakori Hills Community Art Center’s mission
is to preserve the green space of its 72 acre Chatham county homestead.
Required vehicle travel is limited to the paths, with minimal vehicles
allowed in grassy areas. We limit parking to the fullest extent possible.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Parking and Traffic</h2>

<p>In order to help preserve the green space of the Shakori Hills Community
Arts Center, we limit parking to the fullest extent possible in the parking
fields. If it's absolutely necessary to park your car in the camp, you are
required to camouflage it. We encourage you to practice your Creative
License and decorate your vehicle.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Fire Art Safety Team (FAST)</h2>

<p>There is a designated fire pit on site. If you would like to bring a fire barrel
or similar it needs to be off the ground and ashes should be carried out or
put into the designated fire pit. If you plan to bring a fire barrel or similar
please check in with the Fire Art Safety Lead. Propane powered fire pits are
allowed, please make sure they are UL listed for safety. They will also be
inspected by the FAST team.</p>

<p>Fire dancing, and fire arts are permitted, please prepare for safety and get
approval from FAST. Fire performance is at your own risk. You must carry
your own liability insurance. Fire performers must be clear of vegetation
and other flammables, and need to have a bucket of water / damp towel
handy AND a safety person watching out for you at all times.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Effigy Burn</h2>

<p>You will be instructed to stay back when the effigy begins to burn on
Saturday night. Follow all instructions from the perimeter team for your
own safety. Please respect the community by keeping you and your family
safe around the effigy fire. Volunteers for the perimeter team will be
accepted and will be supplied with training prior to the burn.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Flame Effects</h2>

<p>Your flame effects must be inspected and approved by the Fire Marshall on
Thursday, Nov. 7th in order to operate them at Coracle. You must have a
fire extinguisher. Operating flame effects is at your own risk. Those
bringing flame effects take full responsibility for their safe operation, and
prevention of damage to venue property. Most importantly, you take on the
responsibility of operating them in a way that is free from unnecessary
danger to Coracle participants. For participants enjoying flame effects,
please respect the community by keeping you and your family safe around
flame effects.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Sound / Noise</h2>

other protection you require. Do a full body tick check before going to bed
and once you get home.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Consent</h2>

<p>At any burn we must remind ourselves to get consent when interacting
with others whether it be for a hug, offering a drink, etc. This goes even
further than a sexual aspect. With enthusiastic consent, it’s either a HECK
YES or it’s a NO. So, please be absolutely sure that you have a resounding
YES from any other participants before doing anything that involves them,
or you will be asked to leave Coracle Regional Burn immediately with no
refund.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Photos/Video/Recording</h2>

<p>You must have consent before photographing, videotaping or audio
recording any participants at Coracle. Ask for consent.</p>

<p>2” yellow buttons will be available at the gate and the Off-Center Camp to
be used as a simple, visible way for participants to communicate their
preference not to be photographed. These buttons, worn in a prominent
location, will help ensure that attendees can express their desire for
privacy in a clear and respectful manner. The bright color of the buttons
makes them easy to spot, allowing photographers and fellow participants
to respect these boundaries. This initiative aligns with Coracle's focus on
consent and fostering a safe, inclusive environment where everyone can
fully enjoy the event without concern over unwanted documentation.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Gifts</h2>

<p>Disclose what is in your gifts, even if it’s just essential oils. Some people
have sensitivities or allergies.</p>
