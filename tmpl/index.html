<p>We started as a feast and performance shared among friends, against a backdrop of changing autumn leaves in Hillsborough, NC.</p>

<p>Now Coracle is an incubator for ideas and community.</p>

<p>Coracle Regional Burn is being held at Shakori Hills Community Arts Center in Pittsboro, NC on Nov. 8-11, 2024.</p>

<p>Guided by the 10 principles of Burning Man, Coracle celebrates art, community, play and expression. Children of all ages are welcome.</p>

<p>Join the <a target="_blank" href="http://eepurl.com/ikw7jP">Coracle email list</a> to stay apprised of all things Coracle.</p>
