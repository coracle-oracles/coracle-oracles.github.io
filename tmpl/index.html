<h2>Welcome home</h2>

<p>We started as a feast and performance shared among friends, against a backdrop of changing autumn leaves in Hillsborough, NC.</p>

<p>Now Coracle is an incubator for ideas and community.</p>

<p>Coracle Regional Burn will be held at Shakori Hills Community Arts Center in Pittsboro, NC on Nov. 3-5, 2023.</p>

<p>Guided by the 10 principles of Burning Man, Coracle celebrates art, community, play and expression. Children of all ages are welcome.</p>

<p>As the Animalia rise from the desert sea we offer the opportunity to ride out the ebbs ands flows via our community Coracle. Water is powerful, tides constant. When the water and shore meet, the transitions happen. Treasures unearthed, brought to shore, or buried and carried away. It’s nature and it’s powerful. May the tides brings us comfort, joy and magic as we all gather to celebrate the changes we continue to experience in our journey forward.</p>

<p>There is no vending of any kind at Coracle, there are no commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. You must bring everything you need to survive and thrive in early November elements (cold, rain, sunshine). All offerings by participants are offered as a gift, and our temporary celebration thrives on acts of gift-giving, with no expectation of return.</p>

<p>Everyone is invited to help create the weekend. Coracle is an entirely volunteer-produced love offering.</p>

<p>We strive to leave Shakori Hills Community Arts Center even more beautiful than we found it. Each participant is expected to remove all trash, camping gear, and anything else brought for the weekend. We leave no trace of our presence after the weekend is over.</p>

<p>The word Coracle means a small round boat woven together. We communally weave a weekend of celebration, holding everyone’s gifts. You are invited!</p>
