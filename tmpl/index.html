<p>2025 Coracle Theme: Protopian Future</p>

<p>Somewhere between the extremes of a perfect but impossible utopia, and a terrifying dystopia that nobody wants, is a third possible path for the future: Protopia. Writer and futurist Kevin Kelly coined the term to describe a future based on steady progress, better than today but not perfect, and not without setbacks. Predicated not on avarice or despair but on slowly, gradually working to make the world better for everyone, one step at a time.</p>

    <div style="font-weight: bold;">"You can’t see a difference of 1 percent unless you turn around and look behind you. One percent a year, for 100 years — that’s a big difference."</div>

<p>Guided by the 10 principles of Burning Man, Coracle celebrates art, community, play and expression. Children of all ages are welcome. There is no vending of any kind at Coracle, there are no commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. You must bring everything you need to survive and thrive in early November elements (cold, rain, sunshine). All offerings by participants are offered as a gift, and our temporary celebration thrives on acts of gift-giving, with no expectation of return.</p>

<p>Everyone is invited to help create the weekend. Coracle is an entirely volunteer-produced love offering.</p>

<p>We strive to leave the venue even more beautiful than we found it. Each participant is expected to remove all trash, camping gear, and anything else brought for the weekend. We leave no trace of our presence after the weekend is over.</p>

<p>The word Coracle means a small round boat woven together. We communally weave a weekend of celebration, holding everyone's gifts. You are invited!</p>
