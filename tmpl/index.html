<p>2024 Coracle Theme: Creative License</p>

<p>‘Creative License refers to a creator’s freedom to ignore the conventions or rules that normally govern the art in which he or she works.’</p>

<p>The Department of Creative License cordially invites you to Coracle 2024. Here, our Coracle community can tap into the purest form of creative expression. Inside this department, artistic mediums combine and reality itself becomes a suggestion. Self expression is born out of cooperation.</p>

<p>
    <div style="font-weight: bold;">"I am convinced that creativity is a priori to the integrity of the universe and that life is regenerative and conformity meaningless."</div>

</p>

<p>Calling all creative spirits! We welcome you to the Grand Hall of collective muses which houses the Permit Emporium, doling out permits to levitate and create colorful words.</p>

<p>Come dressed as your most outlandish imaginary bureaucrat, contribute your wildest creative ideas, and join us for Coracle, a weekend of unbridled artistic exploration.  Leave your inhibitions at the door, and prepare to unleash your creative license!</p>

<p>Coracle Regional Burn will be at Shakori Hills Community Arts Center in Pittsboro, NC on Nov. 8-11, 2024.</p>

<p>Guided by the 10 principles of Burning Man, Coracle celebrates art, community, play and expression. Children of all ages are welcome.
There is no vending of any kind at Coracle, there are no commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. You must bring everything you need to survive and thrive in early November elements (cold, rain, sunshine). All offerings by participants are offered as a gift, and our temporary celebration thrives on acts of gift-giving, with no expectation of return.</p>

<p>Everyone is invited to help create the weekend. Coracle is an entirely volunteer-produced love offering.</p>

<p>We strive to leave Shakori Hills Community Arts Center even more beautiful than we found it. Each participant is expected to remove all trash, camping gear, and anything else brought for the weekend. We leave no trace of our presence after the weekend is over.</p>

<p>The word Coracle means a small round boat woven together. We communally weave a weekend of celebration, holding everyone's gifts. You are invited!</p>
